Javascript AJAX Example

Client Side = Front-end

Server Side = Back-end

The code found here is client side scripting.
The code on the front-end makes requests to an API in the back-end.
This code will not work because my backend is not being actively hosted right now;
however, this code serves as an example to help you understand AJAX and how requests are received
in JSON format in the front-end.
